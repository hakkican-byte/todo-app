 Experience for Todo List Project
Tool Selection Justification

I chose Cursor because it felt practical and easy to start with. Compared to other vibe coding tools, it did not require learning a completely new platform. Since it works like a normal code editor, I could focus on the project instead of the tool itself.

Another reason was that Cursor understands the whole project structure. Even for a simple Todo List app, this helped when making small changes across different files. Overall, it felt like a reasonable choice for this assignment.

Development Process

I developed the Todo List application step by step. I usually worked on one feature at a time, such as adding tasks, deleting tasks, or saving data. When I was unsure how to implement something, I used Cursor to generate a basic solution and then adjusted it based on my needs.

Some features worked quickly, while others required a few tries. For example, local storage functionality took more than one attempt to work properly. Cursor helped speed things up, but I still needed to test the code and make small fixes manually.

In general, using short and clear prompts worked better than long explanations. The tool was most helpful for repetitive logic and small improvements.

Challenges and Solutions

One challenge was making sure that the generated code actually fit the project. Sometimes the code worked but was not very clean or clear. In those cases, I modified it to make it easier to understand.

Another issue was that small changes sometimes affected other parts of the app. Cursor helped identify where the problem might be, but it did not always solve it automatically. This required me to read the code more carefully and understand how different parts were connected.

Reflection

What I noticed during this project is that vibe coding changes the development process slightly. Instead of writing everything from scratch, I spent more time reviewing and adjusting existing code. This made development feel faster in some parts, but also required attention.

I would use Cursor again for similar projects, especially when starting something new or working on simple applications. However, I still think it is important to understand the code instead of relying completely on the AI. Overall, the tool was useful, but it worked best when combined with manual effort.
