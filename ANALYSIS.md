Vibe Coding Tools and My Observations
Part 1: Research on Vibe Coding Tools
Cursor

Developer: Anysphere

Cursor is an AI-first code editor where artificial intelligence is not just an extra feature but a core part of the development process. While using Cursor, the AI feels more involved in the project because it understands the structure of the codebase instead of only focusing on a single file.

Main Features:

Understanding the whole project, not only one file

Editing and refactoring code with natural language

Detecting errors across multiple files

Chat-based interaction inside the editor

Pricing:
Cursor has a free version with limits and a paid subscription for heavier usage.

Supported Languages:
JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, Java, C/C++ and others.

Windsurf

Developer: Codeium

Windsurf is designed as an agent-based IDE. Instead of waiting for instructions line by line, it can take a task and try to complete it step by step. This makes it feel more autonomous compared to traditional AI tools.

Main Features:

Agent-style task execution

Codebase-level understanding

Automated refactoring

Pricing:
Free and paid plans are available.

Supported Languages:
Most popular programming languages.

Replit Agent

Developer: Replit

Replit Agent focuses on collaboration and speed. Since it runs in the browser, it is especially useful for quickly building and testing applications. The AI acts like a pair programmer that can write, run, and debug code.

Main Features:

AI pair programming

Instant run and deploy

Conversational workflow

Pricing:
Free tier available, paid plans for advanced usage.

Supported Languages:
Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and more.

v0.dev

Developer: Vercel

v0.dev is mostly focused on UI generation. Instead of building full applications, it helps developers create user interfaces quickly using natural language prompts.

Main Features:

Text-to-UI generation

Tailwind CSS and React support

Fast prototyping

Pricing:
Currently free or limited access.

Supported Languages:
Frontend technologies such as React and JSX.

Bolt.new

Developer: StackBlitz

Bolt.new aims to generate full-stack applications. It can create project structures, frontend and backend files, and run them instantly in a browser environment.

Main Features:

Full-stack project creation

Instant development environment

AI-based scaffolding

Pricing:
Free tier with limitations and paid options.

Supported Languages:
JavaScript, TypeScript, and web frameworks.

Part 2: Comparative Analysis
Vibe Coding vs Traditional Code Completion

Traditional code completion tools mostly help by predicting what you want to type next. They are useful for saving time, but they do not really understand the intention behind the code.

Vibe coding tools work differently. Instead of focusing on single lines, they try to understand the goal of the project. For example, when a function name or logic changes, a vibe coding tool can update related files as well. This makes development feel more connected and less repetitive.

However, this also creates new problems. Because vibe coding tools are more confident, they can sometimes change things that were actually working fine. This means the developer still needs to carefully review the code.

Vibe Coding vs GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is very good at generating code snippets and boilerplate. It usually reacts to what the developer is already typing. This makes it fast but also limited.

Vibe coding tools feel more interactive. You can ask them to rethink a solution or refactor a feature, not just complete a line. In this sense, they behave more like a junior developer than an autocomplete tool.

Copilot can sometimes suggest code that looks correct but does not fit well with the existing project structure. Vibe coding tools reduce this problem by using broader context, although they are still not perfect.

Vibe Coding vs ChatGPT or Claude Outside the IDE

Using ChatGPT or Claude in a separate window often requires copying code back and forth. You also need to explain the project again and again, which can be tiring.

When the AI is integrated into the IDE, this problem mostly disappears. The tool already knows the files and structure, so it can give more relevant suggestions. This makes the workflow smoother and less distracting.

Still, external AI tools are useful for learning concepts or brainstorming ideas. Vibe coding tools are more practical when you are actively building or modifying a project.

Conclusion

Each tool has a different purpose. Traditional code completion is good for experienced developers who know exactly what they want. GitHub Copilot is useful for writing common patterns quickly.

Vibe coding tools are more suitable for projects where structure, consistency, and experimentation are important. They do not replace developers, but they change how developers interact with code. Instead of only writing code, the developer also manages and guides the AI.
